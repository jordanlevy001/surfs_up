# Temperature in Oahu Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyze the temperature in Oahu during the month of June and December (over multiple years), to understand if a surf and ice cream shop will be successful year-round. Weather/temperature influences the demand for ice cream and the desire to surf and thus we need to compare the weather in the summer (June) and winter (December) months.

## Results
Three major differences in temperature between June and December

## Summary
High level summary of results
Two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December
