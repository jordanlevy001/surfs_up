# Temperature in Oahu Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyze the temperature in Oahu during the month of June and December (over multiple years), to understand if a surf and ice cream shop will be successful year-round. Weather/temperature influences the demand for ice cream and the desire to surf and thus we need to compare the weather in the summer (June) and winter (December) months.

## Results
There are three key differences in temperature trends between June and December:
- The average temperature in June is higher (75°F) than in December (71°F)
- The minimum temperature in June is higher (64°F) than in December (56°F)
- The maximum temperature in June is higher (85°F) than in December (83°F)

## Summary
Overall, the month of June is warmer, but December is not much colder than June. The average temperature in December is only slightly lower (~4°F) than in June. While December is slightly cooler on average, most days in December were still 69°F or higher.
Two additional queries should be performed to gather more weather data for June and December. The first query should analyze precipitation data during the month of June as rain will also influence the success of a surf and ice cream shop. The second query should analyze precipitation data during the month of December.
